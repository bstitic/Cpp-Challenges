## C++ Challenges

##### These are my solutions to the challenges of each section of the course: "Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond", which is taught by Dr. Frank Mitropoulos. I highly recommend this course: it's very clear, it has exercises in each section, a final challenge (or challenges) in each section as well and it covers a wide variety of C++ topics. There's quite a fun assignment in the course as well and sections start to get considerably more complex as you progress. Personally, I took it to review, practice and learn some more advanced C++ topics. It's been very fun so far too :D  

##### Please note that Section 1, 2, 3 and 5 have no challenges. 

##### Also, I'm only posting files with my implementations here and not files which are required but provided by the instructor. For instance, for the challenge projects of Section 13 (OOP) and Section 14 (operator overloading), there are different .cpp and .h files which are required to compile the projects. As mentioned, files provided by the instructor (Dr. Frank) are not provided here so please refer to the course material of each section to find these files. 

##### Moreover, I've added comments in my code at the top when applicable to explain which files should be retrieved from the course folders to run my project, a brief description of each course file to give an idea of what they consist of to understand my solution and how to edit the original files whenever this is required to run my challenge solution. 

##### I've also added comments to indicate important aspects of my solutions and, in the case of my .cpp files in the Section 13 and Section 14 folders, what pieces of code where made available by the instructor to implement some aspects in the files I'm sharing.  

##### Finally, each folder in this repository is named to briefly describe the primary focus of each corresponding section. Specifically, here I'm sharing:

###### 4. Section 4 (getting started): challenge project 

###### 6. Section 6 (variables, constants): challenge project 

###### 7. Section 7 (arrays, vectors): challenge project 

###### 8. Section 8 (statements, operators): challenge project (please see course files for alternative approach)

###### 9. Section 9 (control flow): challenge project 

###### 10. Section 10 (characters, strings): challenge project and assignment (letter pyramid, very interesting exercise) 

###### 11. Section 11 (functions): challenge project 

###### 12. Section 12 (pointers, references): challenge project (please refer to course files for reference solution)

###### 13. Section 13 (OOP, classes, objects): 2 challenge projects (there were two in this section, one with a vector as an attribute and another with a pointer to a dynamically allocated vector as an attribute); please refer to the course material for required files and modify them as indicated in my solution

###### 14. Section 14 (operator overloading): 2 challenge projects (there were two in this section, one which performed operator overloading using member methods and another which did the same using friend functions); please also refer to the course material for required files and modify them as indicated in my solution 

###### 15. Section 15 (inheritance): challenge project (please refer to course website for reference solution and required files which were not shared here)

###### 16. Section 16 (polymorphism): challenge project (please refer to the course website for reference solution and required files which were not shared here)
